* Numcl [[https://travis-ci.org/numcl/numcl][https://travis-ci.org/numcl/numcl.svg?branch=master]]

This is a Numpy clone in Common Lisp.
At the moment the library is written in pure Common Lisp, focusing more on correctness and usefullness, not speed.

[[https://asciinema.org/a/245792][https://asciinema.org/a/245792.svg]]

** Goals

+ *Closely follow the numpy API, but still make it lispy.*
  +  Delegate the documentation effort to Numpy community.
+ *Replace the Common Lisp array interface.*
  + We do not deviate from the traditional symbols/idioms in Common Lisp unless necessary.
    Therefore we provide symbols that conflicts the Common Lisp symbol.
    Math functions become aliases to the original CL functions when the inputs are not arrays.

** Features/Contracts

+ APIs are provided as functions, not macros.
  + It is a design flaw otherwise.
  + This does not mean the API is functional --- we use procedural code.
+ Still, zero overhead.
  + The APIs are simply the wrappers over simple functions and designed to be fully inlined.
  + Optimization will be done on the compiler side, not by macros.
+ Operations are type-correct.
  + They always return arrays of the most specific array-element-type. For example,
  + (zeros 5) returns a bit vector.
  + (asarray '(1 2 3)) returns an (unsigned-byte 2) vector.
  + (+ 1 (arange 5)) returns an (unsigned-byte 7) vector.
+ NUMCL Arrays are CL arrays.
  + As this library aims to extend Common Lisp (not to replace part of it) in a
    compatible way, we do not introduce custom structures/classes for
    representing an array.

** Examples & documentation

[[./example.lisp]] contains a script that you can explore the functionarity already
implemented in NUMCL.

See [[DETAILS.org]] for the types available in numcl, and object representation.

** Dependencies

NUMCL depends on https://github.com/numcl/constantfold .
This library is at least tested on implementation listed below:

+ SBCL 1.4.12 on X86-64 Linux 4.4.0-141-generic (author's environment)
+ SBCL 1.5.1  on X86-64 Linux 4.4.0-141-generic (author's environment)
+ CI tested on CCL, ECL.

** Packages

NUMCL defines several symbols which have the same name as the corresponding CL
symbols. We call them *conflicting symbols*.  To avoid the confusion in the code
base, we use 3 packages:
+ =NUMCL.IMPL= (internal package) for implementing numcl.
+ =NUMCL.EXPORTED= (external package), for storing the numcl exported symbols,
+ =NUMCL= package, that replaces =COMMON-LISP= package by shadowing-import
  symbols from =NUMCL.EXPORTED= on top of =COMMON-LISP= package.
