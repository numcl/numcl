(define-symbol-macro *einsum-documentation*
  "Note: Broadcasting with `EINSUM` is experimental.

Performs Einstein's summation.
The SUBSCRIPT specification is significantly extended from that of Numpy
and can be seens as a full-brown DSL for array operations.

SUBSCRIPTS is a sequence of the form `(<ISPEC>+ [-> <TRANSFORM>*] [-> <OSPEC>*] [-> <IOPTION>*] [-> <OOPTION>*])`.
The remaining arguments ARGS contain the input arrays and optionally the output arrays.

Inputs are interpreted in the following rule, depending on the number of arrows.

```commonlisp
 (<ISPEC>+)
 (<ISPEC>+ -> <OSPEC>*)
 (<ISPEC>+ -> <TRANSFORM>* -> <OSPEC>*)
 (<ISPEC>+ -> <TRANSFORM>* -> <OSPEC>* -> <IOPTION>*)
 (<ISPEC>+ -> <TRANSFORM>* -> <OSPEC>* -> <IOPTION>* -> <OOPTION>*)
```

# SPEC

The first set of SPECs specifies the input subscripts,
and the second set of SPECs specifies the output subscripts.
Unlike Numpy, there can be multiple output subscripts:
It can performs multiple operations in the same loop, then return multiple values.
The symbol `->` can be a string and can belong to any package because it is compared by `STRING=`.

Each SPEC is an string designator, such as a symbol IJK or a string \"IJK\",
where each character is considered as an index.
Broadcasting can be specified by a hyphen.
It signals a type-error when it contains any non-alpha char except hyphens (-).
Note that a symbol NIL is interpreted as an empty list rather than N, I and L.
Once broadcasting is used in one input, it must be used in all inputs/outputs.

Alternatively, each SPEC can be a list that contains a list of symbols.
For example, `((i j) (j k) -> (i k))` and `(ij jk -> ik)` are equivalent.

When -> and the output SPECs are omitted, a single output is assumed and its spec is
a union of the input specs.
For example, `(ij jk)` is equivalent to `(ij jk -> ijk)`.
Note that `(ij jk)` and `(ij jk ->)` have the different meanings:
The latter sums up all elements.

# TRANSFORM

TRANSFORM is a list of element-wise operations.
The number of TRANSFORM should correspond to the number of outputs.
In each TRANSFORM, the elements in the input arrays can be referenced by $N, where N is a 1-indexed number.
Similarly the output array can be referred to by @N.

+ Example: `(ij ik -> (+ @1 (* $1 $2)) -> ik)` is equivalent to `(ij ik -> ik)` (a GEMM).
+ Example: `(i -> (sin $1) -> i)` is equivalent to mapping a sin function to an array.

By default, TRANSFORM is `(+ @1 (* $1 ... $N))` for N inputs, which is equivalent to Einstein's summation.

# OPTION

Each OPTION is a list of iteration specifiers.
Iteration specifier is a form `(index &key (start 0) (end -1) (step 1))`.
`START` and `END` are the forms specifying the interval designator of the loop range, which supersedes the default full-width loop.
`STEP` is a form specifying the increment of the index.
`INDEX` is a symbol which should match one of the subscripts used in one of the `SPEC`.

For example, you can specify

```commonlisp
 (einsum '(ij jk -> (+ @1 (* $1 $2)) -> ik -> ((j :step 2)) ((j :step 3)))
         (ones '(5 10))
         (ones '(15 5)))
```

to suggest that
     the index `j` for the first array should have a stride of 2,
 and the index `j` for the second array should have a stride of 3.

This is fairly complex, but we hope to provide the maximum flexibility.

# ARGS

The shape of each input array should unify against the corresponding input spec. For example,
with a spec `IJI`, the input array should be of rank 3 as well as
the 1st and the 3rd dimension of the input array should be the same.
Note that this is affected by `OPTIONS` --- when specified,
it uses the number of iteration instead of the size of the dimension.

The shape of each output array is determined by the corresponding output spec.
For example, if `SUBSCRIPTS` is `(ij jk -> ik)`
and the input arrays are NxM and MxL matrices, the output has a shape NxL.

If the output arrays are provided, their shapes and types are also checked against the
corresponding output spec.  The types should match the result of the numerical
operations on the elements of the input arrays.

The outputs are calculated in the following rule.

+ The output array types are calculated based on the `TRANSFORM`, and 
  the shapes are calcurated based on the `SPEC` and the input arrays.
+ The output arrays are allocated and initialized by zeros.
+ Einsum nests one loop for each index in the input specs.
  For example, `(ij jk -> ik)` results in a triple loop.
+ In the innermost loop, each array element is bound to `$1..$N` / `@1..@N`.
+ For each `@i`, `i`-th transform is evaluated and assigned to `@i`.

+ If the same index appears multiple times in a single spec,
  they share the same value in each iteration.
  For example, `(ii -> i)` returns the diagonal elements of the matrix.

When TRANSFORMs are missing, it follows naturally from the default `TRANSFORM` values that

+ When an index used in the input spec is missing in the output spec,
  the axis is aggregated over the iteration by summation.
+ If the same index appears across the different input specs,
  the element values from the multiple input arrays are aggregated by multiplication.
  For example, `(ij jk -> ik)` will perform
  `(setf (aref a2 i k) (* (aref a0 i j) (aref a1 j k)))`
  when a0, a1 are the input arrays and a2 is the output array.

For example, `(einsum '(ij jk) a b)` is equivalent to:

```commonlisp
 (dotimes (i <max> <output>)
   (dotimes (j <max>)
     (dotimes (k <max>)
       (setf (aref <output> i j k) (* (aref a i j) (aref b j k))))))
```

# Performance

If `SUBSCRIPTS` is a constant, the compiler macro
builds an iterator function and make them inlined. Otherwise,
a new function is made in each call to einsum, resulting in a large bottleneck.
 (It could be memoized in the future.)

The nesting order of the loops are automatically decided based on the specs.
The order affects the memory access pattern and therefore the performance due to
the access locality. For example, when writing a GEMM which accesses three matrices
by `(setf (aref output i j) (* (aref a i k) (aref b k j)))`,
it is well known that ikj-loop is the fastest among other loops, e.g. ijk-loop.
EINSUM reorders the indices so that it maximizes the cache locality.

(define-symbol-macro *asarray-documentation*
    "Note: ASARRAY is *SLOW* as it recurses into the substructures.

Copy `CONTENTS` to a new array.
When `CONTENTS` is a multidimentional array, its elements are copied to a new array that guarantees the NUMCL assumption.
When `CONTENTS` is a nested sequence, it is traversed up to the depth that guarantees the sane shape for an array.
When elements are copied, it is coerced to TYPE.
When TYPE is not given, it is replaced with the float-contagion type deduced from the elements of `CONTENTS`.
It may return a 0-dimensional array with `CONTENTS` being the only element.

For example:

```lisp
;; a vector of two lists.
(asarray '((1) (1 2)))               -> #((1) (1 2))
;; a 2D array of 4 lists.
(asarray '(((1) (1 2)) ((3) (3 4)))) -> #2A(((1) (1 2)) ((3) (3 4)))

(asarray '((1 2) (3 4)))    -> #2A((1 2) (3 4))
(asarray #(#(1 2) #(3 4)))  -> #2A((1 2) (3 4))
(asarray #((1 2) (3 4)))    -> #2A((1 2) (3 4))
```

However, this behavior may not be ideal because the resulting shape could be affected by the lengths of the strings.

```lisp
(asarray #(#(1 2) #(3 4)))   -> #2A((1 2) (3 4))
(asarray #(#(1 2) #(3 4 5))) -> #(#(1 2) #(3 4 5))

(asarray #(\"aa\" \"aa\"))   -> #2A((#\a #\a) (#\a #\a))
(asarray #(\"aa\" \"aaa\"))  -> #(\"aa\" \"aaa\")
```

As a remedy to this problem, we allow TYPE to be a specifier for vector subtypes. Providing such a type specifier
will keep the leaf objects (e.g. strings) from split into individual elements.
We don't allow it to be a multidimentional array [at the moment.]

```lisp
(asarray #(#(1 2) #(3 4))   :type '(array fixnum (*))) -> #(#(1 2) #(3 4))
(asarray #(#(1 2) #(3 4 5)) :type '(array fixnum (*))) -> #(#(1 2) #(3 4 5))

(asarray #(\"aa\" \"aa\")  :type 'string)    -> #(\"aa\" \"aa\")
(asarray #(\"aa\" \"aaa\") :type 'string)    -> #(\"aa\" \"aaa\")

(asarray '((1 2) (3 4))   :type '(array fixnum (* *)))  -> error
```
")
