  "The base function for creating a new array satisfying NUMCL-ARRAY-P. (See also: Type NUMCL-ARRAY.)

This function instantiates a fresh 1D array and returns another array
displaced to it with the specified shape. The 1D array is returned as the
secondary value.

The justification for this scheme is that some implementations (esp. SBCL)
require an indirection for accessing the array element (e.g. through
array-header in SBCL) even for a simple multi-dimentional array and thus using a
displacing array has essentially no performance penalty over using a simple
multi-dimentional array.

We also ensure that the length of the base arrays are the multiples of 8.
This ensures that the program can safely iterate over that extended region
with a future support for SIMD operations in mind.

When DISPLACED-TO is given, it should be a numcl array
and the returned array is displaced to its 1D backing array
with the same offsets as the DISPLACED-TO.

When DISPLACED-INDEX-OFFSET is also given, the actual offset is
the specified offset plus the original offset in DISPLACED-TO.

When DISPLACED-TO and ELEMENT-TYPE are given, the upgraded-array-element-type of ELEMENT-TYPE
should be TYPE= to the actual array element type of DISPLACED-TO.

When DISPLACED-TO is given and ELEMENT-TYPE is not given,
ELEMENT-TYPE is simply the actual array element type of DISPLACED-TO.
