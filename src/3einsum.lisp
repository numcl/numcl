  "Normalizes the input to the einsum.
It first 'explodes' each spec into the list form.
It then generates the default output form, if missing.

It then translates the index symbols into a number
based on the order of appearance; This should make
the specs with the different symbols into the canonical form,
e.g. `(ij jk -> ik)` and `(ik kj -> ij)` both results in something equivalent to
 `((0 1) (1 2) -> (0 2))`.

The subscripts are converted into numbers in order to cache the resulting compiled function
when einsum is called with a dynamically generated subscript.

It then inserts the default transforms, if missing.

The value returned is a plist of :i-specs, :transforms, :o-specs.
For example, `(einsum-normalize-subscripts '(ik kj -> ij))` returns

```lisp
  (:i-specs    ((0 1) (1 2))
   :transforms ((+ @1 (* $1 $2)))

how to make it loop at a certain index?

example scenario: broadcast + between (2 1 5) array A and (5 5) array B.

first reshape B to (1 5 5).

(einsum '(ijk ijk ->  (+ $1 $2)  -> ijk) A B) ??

(einsum '(-k -k ->  (+ $1 $2)  -> -k) A B) ??

you will get an array C with shape (2 5 5).

(einsum '(ij jk -> ik) a b c)
(einsum '(i-j -jk -> ik-) a b c)
(einsum '(i-j -jk -> ik) a b c)
(einsum '(i-i i-i i-i -> -i) a b c)

(einsum '(i- -j -> ij) a b c)

(einsum '(i- i- -> i-) a b c)

(einsum '(ij jk -> (+ @1 (* $1 $2)) -> ik) a b c)

(einsum '(ii -> i ) a b)

(einsum '(i -> i) (ones 5))

(einsum '(ij jk -> (+ @1 (* $1 $2)) -> ik -> ((i :step 2)) ) a b c)

;; should error
(einsum '(ij jk -> (+ @1 (* $1 $2)) -> ik -> ((i :step *special-value*)) ) a b c)
