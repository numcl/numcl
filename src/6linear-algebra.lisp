  "Performs Einstein's summation.
SUBSCRIPTS is a sequence of the form (<SPEC>* [-> [<SPEC>]]).
The first set of specs specifies the input subscripts, and the last spec specifies the output subscripts.

Each SPEC is an alphabetical string designator, such as a symbol IJK, where each alphabet is considered as an index.
The shape of the input array should unify against the spec. For example,
with a spec IJI, the input array should be of rank 3 as well as
the 1st and the 3rd dimensions of the input array should be the same.

Performace tips: If SUBSCRIPTS is a constant, the compiler macro
builds an iterator function and make them inlined. Otherwise,
a new function is made in each call to einsum, resulting in a huge bottleneck.
